** Inheritance ** 

Inheritance is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming. Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior that is defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. A derived class can have only one direct base class. However, inheritance is transitive. If ClassC is derived from ClassB, and ClassB is derived from ClassA, ClassC inherits the members declared in ClassB and ClassA.
Conceptually, a derived class is a specialization of the base class. For example, if you have a base class Animal, you might have one derived class that is named Mammal and another derived class that is named Reptile. A Mammal is an Animal, and a Reptile is an Animal, but each derived class represents different specializations of the base class.


using System;
namespace InheritanceApplication
{
class Shape 
{
   public void setWidth(int w)
   {
      width = w;
   }
   public void setHeight(int h)
   {
      height = h;
   }
   protected int width;
   protected int height;
}

// Derived class
class Rectangle: Shape
{
   public int getArea()
   { 
      return (width * height); 
   }
}

class RectangleTester
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      Rectangle Rect = new Rectangle();

      Rect.setWidth(5);
      Rect.setHeight(7);

      // Print the area of the object.
      Console.WriteLine("Total area: {0}",  Rect.getArea());
      Console.ReadKey();
   }
}
}
